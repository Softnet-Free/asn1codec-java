# The developer’s guide to Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)
This guide provides the specification for the API of the Softnet ASN.1 Codec written in Java. The codec is developed as part of the Softnet project, but can also be used on its own. Softnet uses it to represent data in ASN.1 DER format for network data transmission. The product does not yet support ASN.1 compiler features, which is the subject of further product development.

Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java) is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

To use the codec in applications, include the ‘jar’ file of the codec into your project and import the ‘softnet.asn’ package.
