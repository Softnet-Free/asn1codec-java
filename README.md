# Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)

This is the Java source code for Softnet ASN.1 Codec. It was developed as part of the Softnet Free project, but can also be used on its own. The product does not yet support ASN.1 compiler features, which is the subject of further product development. The encoder takes data represented using Java data types as input and converts it into an ASN.1 DER encoded format. The decoder, in turn, is designed to handle input data that adheres to the ASN.1 DER format. To use the codec in applications, include the jar file “[asncodec.jar](https://github.com/Softnet-Free/asn1codec-java/releases)” and import the ‘softnet.asn’ package.
