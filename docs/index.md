# The Developer Guide to Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)
{: .fs-7 }

by Robert Koifman  

This guide provides the specification for the API of the Softnet ASN.1 Codec in Java. The codec is developed as part of the Softnet project, but can also be used on its own. Softnet uses the codec to represent data in ASN.1 DER format for network data transmission. The product does not yet support ASN.1 compiler features, which is the subject of further product development.
